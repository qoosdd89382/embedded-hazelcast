# Embedded Hazelcast in Spring Boot Application With Spring Session

This repository is based on Hazelcast official guide in the first place, and I made a few improvements to watch activities of session clearly.

## What's the concepts I want to proof
- Run a Spring Boot application successfully with Spring Session Core, Hazelcast dependencies.
- Session can actually be controlled and managed by Spring Session.
- Session can be transferred/saved to embedded Hazelcast member through Spring Session in Spring Boot application.
- The Hazelcast members which embedded in a few running multiple Spring Boot applications can be grouped as a Hazelcast cluster. 
- All the members of Hazelcast cluster can synchronize and share session they saved each other.
