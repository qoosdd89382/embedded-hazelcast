# Embedded Hazelcast in Spring Boot Application With Spring Session

This repository is based on Hazelcast's official guide, and I have made several improvements to better monitor session activities.

## What concepts do I want to demonstrate?
- Successfully run a Spring Boot application with Spring Session Core and Hazelcast dependencies.
- Demonstrate that Spring Session can effectively manage and control sessions.
- Demonstrate that session can be transferred/saved to embedded Hazelcast members through Spring Session in a Spring Boot application.
- Show that Hazelcast members embedded in multiple running Spring Boot applications can be grouped as a Hazelcast cluster.
- Demonstrate that all members of a Hazelcast cluster can synchronize and share sessions they have saved.
